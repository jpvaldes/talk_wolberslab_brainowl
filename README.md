# Introducing the BrainOwl

This is the source for a talk about the BrainOwl classifier I will give to the
other [Wolberslab](http://www.wolberslab.net) members. It will take place at the
DZNE Magdeburg on the 30th of January, 2019.

The talk will be followed by a live demo.

## Create PDF from talk source

The talk is written in LaTeX using Beamer, so you need a working LaTeX
installation to compile to PDF. If you already have LaTeX, the provided
`Makefile` will take care of the compilation.

To create the PDF, clone the repository and run from within the talk directory:

```bash
make
```
